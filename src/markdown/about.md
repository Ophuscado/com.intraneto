# About

"Intraneto" is a combination of the words "Intranet" and the character "O", which sounds like a robot. The name also incorporates the concept of input/output (I/O) in computer science, which refers to the transfer of data between a computer and its operator or external devices, normally after being processed.

Intraneto is a software platform that utilizes intelligence to provide a new way to access and analyze scientific knowledge. With the explosion of scientific literature and data, it has become increasingly difficult to discover useful insights in a large mass of information.
